Python tools can handle all those steps. For linting, tools like flake8, pylint, or black help enforce style guides and catch potential errors early. For testing, pytest is a good choice due to its simplicity and extensibility in Python ecosystem. For building and packing the application, setuptools and wheel are standard tools when preparing Python packages for deployment or distribution.

There are other alternatives such as GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, Travis CI, and Bitbucket Pipelines. Each has its own strengthness. For example, GitLab CI is deeply integrated into GitLab repositories, and CircleCI offers fast container-based builds with easy Docker support.

The setup is better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment depends on several factors. A cloud-based setup is usually easier to manage and scales well for small to medium-sized teams. It also removes the overhead of maintaining servers. However, a self-hosted CI might be preferred if there are strict security or compliance requirements, or if the codebase is private and cannot be exposed to external services. To make a decision, we’d need to assess the team’s expertise, security policies, cost constraints, and the expected scale of the application.
